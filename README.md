”TRAVEL BOOKING SYSTEM”,is a management
software for assisting the users to book their tours in and around
India.This software will provide a basic set of features like
creating a table that displays travel packages , store customer
details and their travel details in rdbms and then analyse this
data. In this user friendly project, we have considered a travel
agency, ”TRAVELOPEDIA”, which creates a realistic account
customers , with auto generated user_id and requires password to
login. The agency offers packages that are already planned to
visit different places , stay at the designated hotels with the set
duration.The project also allows customers to update their details
such as phone number , Aadhar numbers, etc ,book tours ,update
the tours and delete them as well .
